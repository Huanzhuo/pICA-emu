## Description

This application emulate the progressive ICA in the network, it is **based on the [comnetsemu](https://git.comnets.net/public-repo/comnetsemu)**.

## Requirements

Please install `vagrant` and `Virtualbox` on the host OS to build the testbed VM.

## Getting Started

Please run follow steps to setup the emulator. Assume the source directory of `pICA-emu` project is `~/pICA-emu`.

### Option1: Install in a Vagrant managed VM (Highly Recommended)

1. Create the testbed VM using Vagrant on your host OS.
    ```bash
    cd ~/pICA-emu || exit
    vagrant up testbed
    ```
    Then run `vagrant ssh testbed` to login into the VM. Following steps should be run **inside the VM**.

2. Install `docker-ce` and add docker into user group
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install  apt-transport-https  ca-certificates curl  software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64]  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable" 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce

    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo gpasswd -a vagrant docker
    newgrp docker

    cd /home/vagrant/comnetsemu/test_containers || exit
    sudo bash ./build.sh
    ```

3. Upgrade ComNetsEmu Python module and all dependencies automatically inside VM
    ```bash
    cd ~/comnetsemu/util
    bash ./install.sh -u
    ```

4. Run test to make sure the `ComNetsEmu` is installed correctly (optional).
    ```bash
    cd ~/comnetsemu
    sudo make test
    ```
    Only run following steps when all tests passed without any errors. Otherwise, please create issues on [Github](https://github.com/stevelorenz/comnetsemu/issues) from Zuo Xiang.

### Option2: Install on user's custom VM or directly on host OS (Ubuntu20.04)

1. Install the comnetsemu and simpleemu on your host OS.
    ```bash
    cd ~/pICA-emu/emu-installer || exit
    bash ./install.sh
    ```

2. Install the docker image for pICA.
    ```bash
    cd ~/pICA-emu || exit
    sudo bash ./build_docker_images.sh
    ```

3. Run the topology in the folder ```~/pICA-emu/emulator```:
    ```bash
    cd ~/pICA-emu/emulator
    sudo python3 ./topo.py
    ```
    Then, the next steps are the same as below

## Run pICA in the Emulator

1. Install docker image of pICA:
   ```bash
   cd /vagrant
   sudo bash ./build_docker_images.sh
   ```
    After this step, you should see the image with name ```pica_dev``` when running ```docker image ls```.
    You should change your work path inside the VM for following steps.

2. Run the topology in the folder ```/vagrant/emulator```:
    ```bash
    cd /vagrant/emulator
    sudo python3 ./topo.py
    ```
    You should see the prompt `mininet>` when the network configuration is finished.
    And five terminals are popped up, you can identify client, server, VNF, swich, and a controller by looking at the host name (e.g., `@client`) in the shell.

    The number of VNFs is defined as 2 in ```topo.py```. For an arbitary number of VNFs, please define the value of ```n_vnf``` in ```topo_n_vnf.py``` and run ```topo_n_vnf.py``` instead of ```topo.py```.

3. Please firstly run `server.py` inside the server's shell, then the rest. The default work mode is ```compute-and-forward``` (```cf```). With the flag ``` sf``` on the client, the work mode will be changed to ```store-and-forward```. With the flag ```n_test``` on the client, an integer value is expected to set the evaluation rounds.
    ```bash
    # in the server terminal
    sudo python3 ./server.py

    # in the vnf terminal
    sudo python3 ./vnf.py

    # in the client terminal
    sudo python3 ./client.py cf n_test
    ```
